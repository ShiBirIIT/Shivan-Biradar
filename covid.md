**Real Time Forecasting of an Epidemic Using Discrete Time Stochastic Model: A Case Study of Pandemic Covid-19**

This work recognises the stochastic nature of the epidemic dynamics and uses the concepts of well established stochastic models like Reed-Frost model and Greenwood Model, to predict the epidemiological trend of the prevalence and incidence of COVID-2019. <br /><br />
The Algorithm described is based on a premise that a person in susceptible population can either be infected or escapes the infection with certain probability when he comes in adequate contact with an infective. This process creates a chain of infection in population. The
Algorithm-2 models this chain of infection as a binomial process, and estimates the probabilities, which can be further used to predict incidence of COVID-19.

# Basics
## Introduction
Before diving into the details of algorithm, lets look at some epidemiological term for better understanding.<br /> 
The population comprises of two set of individuals. Those who are already infected are called as infectives and those capable of receiving the infection are called susceptible. The models assumes that all the individuals in population have equal probability of being susceptible and spreading the disease.
## Definitions
1. **Latent or Incubation time period**: The period of time during which development of disease is purely internal to the infected person.<br />

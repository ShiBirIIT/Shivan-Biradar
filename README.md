# About me
I am a first year PhD student in Department of Electrical Engineering, at IIT Delhi. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Deepak Patil ](http://web.iitd.ac.in/~deepakpatil/) in the Laboratory for Control and Automation. Earlier, I completed my Masters at Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee.
Before graduate school, I was a part of Integrated Control Guidance and Estimation Lab at Indian Institute of Science. 
I have also spent some time at KIIT Bhubhaneswar teaching undergrads.
